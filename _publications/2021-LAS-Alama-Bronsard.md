We consider two nonlocal variational models arising in physical contexts. The first is
the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-von Weizsacker (TFDW) model, introduced in the study of ionization of
atoms and molecules, and the second is the liquid drop model with external potential, proposed by
Gamow in the context of nuclear structure. It has been observed that the two models exhibit many
of the same properties, especially in regard to the existence and nonexistence of minimizers. We show
that, under a “sharp interface” scaling of the coefficients, the TFDW energy with constrained mass
Γ-converges to the liquid drop model for a general class of external potentials. Finally, we present
some consequences for global minimization of each model.
