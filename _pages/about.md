Welcome to my home page! 

I am currently a Limited Term Assistant Professor at Lakehead University, Georgian-Barrie Campus. 

My research interests include Pattern formation in the Calculus of
Variations and PDEs both theoretically and computationally, and 
Reflective Practices in 
Teaching and Learning Mathematics.
